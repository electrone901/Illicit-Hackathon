# Illicit hackathon: Swift Check


## Inspiration
Community banking is ubiquitous internationally throughout history to allow groups of people to pool together and create financial stability through social bonds.

## Description

Swift Check is an application that allows users to deposit their checks digitally through a photograph so they can have quick and easy access to their funds without the high fees, long wait times, and general inefficiencies of traditional check cashers. Swift Check also provide users with a debit card to make online payments and withdraw cash.
